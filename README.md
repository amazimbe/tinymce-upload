# upload TinyMCE Plugin

Welcome stranger! This is a repo containing the upload TinyMCE plugin.

## Setting up

Clone the plugin's repository and change into the main directory. Run `npm install` followed by `bower install` to install
dependencies.

## The development server

By running the `npm start` command you start the development server and open a browser window with an instance of TinyMCE with your plugin added to it. This window will reload automatically whenever a change is detected in the `index.html` file in the `static` folder or in one of the JavaScript files in the `src` directory.

## The production build

By running the `npm run build` command Webpack will create a `dist` directory with a child directory with the name of your plugin (upload) containing three files:

* `plugin.js` - the bundled plugin
* `plugin.min.js` - the bundles, uglified and minified plugin
* `LICENSE` - a file explaining the license of your plugin (copied over from `src/LICENSE`)
